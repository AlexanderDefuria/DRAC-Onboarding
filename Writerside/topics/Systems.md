# Systems
The Digital Research Alliance of Canada provides several advanced research computing systems and services to support Canadian researchers:

## High-Performance Computing Clusters

The Alliance operates several national HPC clusters (below). Each of these clusters has slightly different behaviours and for specific information the 

- **Fir**: Replacing the Cedar cluster
- **Rorqual**: Replacing the BÃ©luga cluster
- **Trillium**: Replacing Niagara and Mist clusters
- **Nibi**: Replacing the Graham cluster

## Cloud Computing

The Alliance provides cloud computing services, including:

- **Arbutus**: A virtual infrastructure cloud system
- **Cedar Cloud**: Offering persistent and compute cloud resources[14]

## Storage Systems

Large-scale storage is available on the HPC clusters, including:

- **Fir storage**: Offering backup storage capabilities
- Storage on other clusters like Graham2[14]

## Additional Services

- **Database servers**
- **Globus file transfer service**
- **Nextcloud cloud storage**[5]

## Software and Support

- Hundreds of pre-installed research software packages
- Technical support and training for users
- Access to visualization systems[4]

The Alliance aims to provide a comprehensive digital research infrastructure to advance Canada's research capabilities across all academic disciplines. Researchers can access these systems free of charge, with larger resource allocations available through a competitive application process[15].
