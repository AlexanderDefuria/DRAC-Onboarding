# HPC Workshop


These exercises have been developed as a part of the HPC Workshop Series run at the University of Ottawa by Alexander De Furia, and held with the support of DRAC, Minds on AI uOttawa, and the uOttawa-IBM CyberRange. 

All of these exercises are designed such that one can complete them using any SLURM based HPC system. The exercises are designed to be completed in order, as each exercise builds on the previous one. Supplemental instruction and learning about basic Linux commands beyond Exercise 0 is encouraged but not required to complete the exercises. Designed to run on a Magic Castle training cloud instantiation, these exercises have also been tested on Compute Canada's Cedar and Graham clusters. It is encouraged to use the Magic Castle training cloud for the best experience.


With all that being said, HPC can be daunting at first, but with practice and patience, you will be able to harness the power of HPC systems to run your code faster and more efficiently than ever before. Best of luck!
