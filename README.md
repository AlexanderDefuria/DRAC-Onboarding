# DRAC-Onboarding
** Improving accessibility to advanced computing resources in Canada  **

## What are we doing?

### The Problem
Currently the DRAC hosts a very large knowledge base on their online documentation website and virtual webinars. This information however is not particularly accesible with multiple modalities, confusing and arbitrary locations for information, and a simply overwhelming amount of information to sift through to have a simple program run. The current documentation is well suited to someone who can very quickly jump around and read complex documentation quickly, as well as people who are able to easily watch and listen to videos. Both modalities are needed to have a quick and effective experience getting started. This is not suited to all people wishing to use these resources. People living with disabilities can struggle with one or more of the current requirements and presently have no good alternative.

### The Solution
This project's goal is to revise the current DRAC ARC "Getting Started" and onboarding procedures with the following goals:
- Centralizing all relevant resources to get simple programs running.
- Documenting common questions and where to find detailed explanations.
- Creation of written and video guides that are identical in content.
- Community consultation to improve dissemination of information.


## Who are we?
This project is led by Alexander De Furia, a graduate student at the University of Ottawa, working in collaboration with Dr. Paula Branco and various student associations and STEM groups focused on underrepresented communities.

## Who do we need?
We need participation and feedback from:
- People living with visible or invisible disabilities
- Neurodiverse individuals
- Geographically isolated groups
- First-generation post-secondary students
- Any other equity-seeking groups facing barriers to accessing DRI

We also welcome expertise in:
- Accessibility design
- Technical writing
- User experience design
- Workshop facilitation
